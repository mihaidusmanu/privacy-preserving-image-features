## Requirements

OpenMP and Eigen must be installed prior to the setup of this repository. CUDA is also a recommended dependency for best performance.

1. Start by creating and activating the base python environment:
```
conda env create --file=env.yml; conda activate ppif
```
2. Install the `pyppif` bindings:
```
cd py_ppif; pip install .; cd ..
```
3. [Optional] Install the `pyppifcuda` bindings:
```
cd py_ppif_cuda; pip install .; cd ..
```

## HPatches Sequences evaluation

Start by installing COLMAP (used for SIFT feature extraction) and set the env variable COLMAP_PATH to the COLMAP executable, e.g.:
```
export COLMAP_PATH=~/sources/colmap/build/src/exe/colmap
```

1. Download the dataset:
```
bash download_hpatches_sequences.sh
```
2. Extract SIFT / DoG + HardNet features:
```
python feature-utils/extract_sift.py --dataset_path data/hpatches-sequences-release/ --colmap_path $COLMAP_PATH
python feature-utils/extract_hardnet.py --dataset_path data/hpatches-sequences-release/
```
3. Run the evaluation:
```
python evaluate_hpatches_sequences.py --dataset_path data/hpatches-sequences-release/ --descriptor sift
python evaluate_hpatches_sequences.py --dataset_path data/hpatches-sequences-release/ --descriptor hardnet
```
